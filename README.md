## Requirements
This was originally built to run on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B running [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk/). I've been able to get it working on my [MiSTer](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki) as well. I'm sure it would work on other [Retroarch](https://www.retroarch.com/)'s or with any system that's capturing screenshots or videos. I wouldn't try this on an older Pi 1, or single core system. The screenshot stuff should work (maybe this should be configurable?) but the recording/gif converting would likely be too slow on a single core system (it can already bog down the Pi 3 at times).

Requirements:

| software    | command   | version  |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| cargo       | `cargo`   | >=0.22.0 |
| gifski      | `gifski`  | =0.8.2   |
| ffmpeg      | `ffmpeg`  | =3.1.4   |

You need cargo to compile. gifski and ffmpeg are only required for video encoding and if you're only capturing screenshots they're not required.

If you are setting these things up on RetroPie you can follow these guides:

- [Recording Live Gameplay in RetroPie’s RetroArch Emulators Natively on the Raspberry Pi](https://retroresolution.com/2016/07/06/recording-live-gameplay-in-retropies-retroarch-emulators-natively-on-the-raspberry-pi/#li_before_proceeding)
- [Recording gameplay videos on RetroPie](https://www.artificialworlds.net/blog/2018/01/07/recording-gameplay-videos-on-retropie/) ([with some handy shell scripts!](https://github.com/andybalaam/retropie-recording))
- [I also ran into this snag](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/issues/5717#issuecomment-357494398)

## Installation
clone this repo somewhere:  
`git clone git@github.com:rickycodes/retrorecord.git`

## Configuration
The application requires the following environment variables to be `export`ed on your system eg:

```sh
export TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY= \
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET= \
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN= \
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET= \
SCREENSHOTS_DIR=/home/pi/.config/retroarch/screenshots/ \
RECORDINGS_DIR=/home/pi/recordings/ \
GIFS_DIR=/home/pi/gifs/
```
The directories should match what you have set on the system. `/home/pi/.config/retroarch/screenshots/` above is common for `retroarch`, 

If you don't have the above env vars set the application will quit on startup:
```
application started...
prompts are OFF
Couldn't read SCREENSHOTS_DIR (environment variable not found)
```

## Cross compilation
If you're interested in building a bin that works on a pi from a non armv7 arch I've included [a Docker file](Dockerfile) and [a build script](build.sh) which provide some clues on how to do this.

### Building the container
`docker build -t retrorecord .`

### Running it
`docker run --publish 8000:8000 --detach --name rr retrorecord`

### Building on the container
`docker exec -it rr cargo build --verbose --target=armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf --release`

This will create a release bin that you can then move to to your pi or host os eg:

`wget http://localhost:8000/target/armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf/release/retrorecord`

Don't forget to make it executable!

`sudo chmod +x retrorecord`

If you try running on an arch that doesn't match the target you'll get:

`bash: ./retrorecord: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error`

## Build
build with cargo:  
`cargo build`  
or:  
`cargo build --release`

## Tests
run unit tests:  
`cargo test --verbose`

## Startup
run the binary:  
`./retrorecord`  
or:  
`./retrorecord --prompt`  
(this will prompt you before posting)

## Usage:
run the binary:  
`./retrorecord`  
and you should see:  
```sh
application started...
prompts are OFF
```

### Screenshot:
| <img src='./screenshots/retroarch-main-menu.png' /> |
|-|
| Get to a screen in game that you'd like to capture and enter the main menu of RetroArch: |
| <img src='./screenshots/retroarch-screenshot.png' /> |
| Go into the "Quick Menu" and select "Take Screenshot": |

retrorecord will print something like this to stdout:  
```sh
file written: "/home/pi/.config/retroarch/screenshots/Super Mario Bros 3 (U) (PRG 1)-180425-190211.png"
posted tweet!
```

### Recording

| <img src='./screenshots/hit-a.png' /> |
|-|
|Launch a game that has an emulator with an option where you've enabled recording: <br />(Press a button to configure):|
| <img src='./screenshots/default-emulator.png' />      |
| Select default emulator, or Select emulator for ROM: |
| <img src='./screenshots/default-emulator-record.png' />  |
| Select the emulator where you've enabled recording: |
| <img src='./screenshots/default-emulator-record-launch.png' /> |
| Now simply launching the game will start recording: |

Once you exit the game the recording will stop and you should seem some ffmpeg output from retrorecord followed by:  
```sh
gif complete!
gif_path is "/home/pi/gifs/output.gif"
posted tweet!
```
If you want to record specific sections of a game consider using save states: play the game with the normal emulator to a point where you'd like to start recording, save state then relaunch with the recording enabled and load state to record from that point onward.

## Notes
All this app really does is watch folders for screenshots & recordings, so presumably you could get this to work on most systems? While this was used to create [whatmeplaying](https://twitter.com/whatmeplaying) you could use a similar setup to post screenshots/videos/gifs from games to anywhere (so long as there's an API of some sort).

Most of the magic (literally ImageMagick) is in the [mkvToGif.sh](https://github.com/rickycodes/retrorecord/blob/master/mkvToGif.sh) file
